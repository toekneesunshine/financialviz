"Is American Airlines Making The Most Of Its Increased Cash Flows? Sustained weakness in global crude oil prices continues to create an upsurge in the profits of the majority of the US airlines. The top six US airlines – American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL)   United Continental (NYSE:UAL)   Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL)   Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV)   Alaska Air Group (NYSE:ALK) and JetBlue Airways (NYSE:JBLU) – delivered a GAAP net profit of $5.4 billion in the June 2015 quarter   which is 62% higher compared to the profits earned in the same quarter last year. Since the timing of the rebound in oil prices is unknown   US airlines are taking all possible measures to judiciously utilize the excess cash flows to mitigate the sensitivity of their earnings to the oil prices to some extent. These measures include re-fleeting of aircraft   reducing debt obligations   and returning value to the shareholders. In this article   we will analyze the strategies being adopted by American Airlines and determine if the airline is making the best use of the extra cash at its disposal. Our price estimate for American Airlines stands at $48 per share   about 20% ahead of its current market price.Let’s begin by looking at American Airlines’ current financial status. The world’s largest airline (by traffic) reported a net income of $1.7 billion in the second quarter of 2015   almost double the profits generated a year ago((American Airlines Second Quarter 10Q filing   24th July 2015   www.aa.com)). This huge jump in profits was driven primarily by the airline’s no hedging policy   which resulted in fuel cost savings of more than $1 billion. Consequently   the airline generated operating cash flows of $4.8 billion in the first six months   which are expected to grow even higher in the later half of the year. However   the airline currently has long-term debt of close to $19 billion on its balance sheet. This translates into a debt to capitalization rate of over 42%   which is much higher than the industry average. Thus   the most logical use of the extra cash generated during the year should be to pay down the airline’s long term debt. However   the airline does not seem to be taking that path.On the contrary   the Fort Worth-based airline is using its cash flows to overhaul its existing fleet of aircraft. The airline expects to spend close to $5.4 billion on new aircraft in 2015   which should be easily funded through its annual operating cash flows and some incremental debt   if required. Though it may appear irrational at first to take on more debt to finance newer aircraft   things become clearer if we take a closer look. The airline had ordered several Airbus A320-neo aircraft before filing for bankruptcy in 2011. However   it has been delaying in taking the delivery of these planes due to a variety of reasons. But now   with stronger cash flows   the airline is set to replace its older and smaller planes with bigger and more fuel-efficient planes. These planes will not only enable the airline to expand its capacity to fight the increasing competition   but will also improve the airline’s operational efficiency   that will reflect on its margins in the long term. However   that does not resolve the issues related to a highly levered balance sheet. American Airline is fully aware of the concerns that an excess leverage can cause and as a result   the airline has been proactively working towards reducing it. The legacy carrier has paid down over $3 billion of its high cost debt since its merger with US Airways in December 2013 and has refinanced the remaining debt at lower rates. For example   the airline has raised a new debt financing of $1.7 billion with a blended rate of 3.7%   which is very low compared to the industry standards. Thus   despite having a huge amount of debt on its books   the interest obligation of the airline has actually gone down due to the lower interest rates. This implies that the airline is quick enough to take advantage of any attractive opportunity which can prove to be beneficial in the long term. Apart from re-fleeting   American Airlines is investing its cash flows on repurchasing its own shares from the market. In the second quarter   the airline repurchased 17.3 million shares worth $753 million((American Airlines Second Quarter 10Q filing   24th July 2015   www.aa.com)). Further   the legacy carrier authorized a $2 billion share repurchase program to be completed by 2016   in addition to an existing $2 billion repurchase program approved in January 2015.  In addition to this   the airline has been paying a quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share over the last four quarters. In all   the airline has returned approximately $1.1 billion to its shareholders in the first half of 2015. This indicates the airline’s willingness to share its growing profits with its shareholders   which is likely to reinforce investor confidence in the airline.To conclude we would say that while the high debt on American Airlines’ books is likely to raise investor concerns   the airline knows what it is doing and its strategy is likely to bear fruits in the long term.",negative
"Zika virus worries weigh on the travel industry Tourism and travel-related stocks have taken a hit from worries surrounding the Zika virus   and though many were moving higher Monday   most are still trading below their levels from a week ago. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it has confirmed that 31 Americans have become infected   all after traveling to one of the 24 countries or territories with the outbreaks. The region hardest hit by the mosquito-borne virus is the Caribbean   Central and South America   where several major U.S.-based cruise line   airline and hotel chains operate. Shares in travel-related companies regained some lost ground on Friday   and were mixed Monday   but are still mostly below their levels from before the virus began gaining attention. They're also underperforming the wider market. "Cruise line stocks have underperformed the market by quite a bit — and so have travel group stocks in general because of concerns about Zika  " Wells Fargo Securities analyst Tim Conder said late last week. Among cruise operator stocks   Norwegian Cruise Line dropped more than 5 percent last week   Royal Caribbean fell 4 percent   and Carnival declined nearly 3 percent. Even Walt Disney   operator of the Disney Cruise Line   slipped more 1 percent for the week."The Caribbean is the top market for all of these companies   especially Norwegian Cruises  " said C. Patrick Scholes   a lodging and leisure equity analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphey. He added that the exposure for Disney shouldn't be as significant because "Disney Cruise Line is a small part of a giant corporation."Shares of Norwegian were nearly 3 percent higher Monday   but that company and most other travel shares still had not reclaimed the losses they experienced last week. Within the airline sector   Delta Air Lines lost about 6 percent last week   American Airlines Group dipped nearly 3 percent and JetBlue Airways gave back about 1 percent. Hotel stocks weren't spared: Hilton Worldwide lost nearly 3 percent   Marriott International fell about 2 percent and Starwood Hotels and Choice Hotels International each declined about 1 percent. In Brazil alone   an estimated 1.5 million people have been infected   according to the World Health Organization. "There is a concern that the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro   Brazil will result in wider spread of the disease globally  " Cowen & Co. analyst Helane Becker said in a research note Thursday. The WHO forecasts up to 4 million people in the Americas are at risk of getting infected   and the CDC is warning pregnant women to consider postponing travel to the areas where the virus transmission is ongoing. The virus has been linked to microcephaly   a serious birth defect. Industry analysts said it is too early to gauge the impact for travel-related companies but noted many of the airline and cruise lines are offering credits or refunds to expectant mothers."As of yet we haven't see a material change in bookings  " American Airlines Group President Scott Kirby said Friday during the carrier's fourth-quarter earnings conference call. JetBlue's executive vice president of commercial and planning   Marty St. George   told analysts Thursday that "we've really seen no measurable impact either to advance bookings or customer refunds." According to Conder   the worst-case scenario for the cruise segment is that booking demand gets cut by about 6 percent   or 1.4 million travelers out of about 24 million. He said major cruise operators generally prohibit women who are 24 or more weeks pregnant to board   so "that would cut the estimate by a third."Added the analyst   "We're not diminishing the seriousness of Zika or how it's spreading   but if you compare it to Ebola the primary risk appears to be women who are pregnant. Ebola is a much more dire situation for anyone. Even if it does spread — and probably will — efforts being marshaled will help contain it."",negative
"Worried fliers wear masks as precaution against Ebola Corbin Fawley knew he stood out on his Frontier Airlines flight from Denver to Dallas. But that was fine with him. Fawley wore a surgical mask and rubber gloves to give himself what he considered an extra level of protection against the Ebola virus   even though it's not airborne. Instead   it's spread through contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person who is showing symptoms of the virus."I am not losing anything by putting on gloves and a mask. It is just an extra precaution  " Fawley said from the baggage claim area."How can they [the federal government] significantly regulate something like this? I mean   that's why I was taking matters into my own hands to protect myself from it  " he said.Fawley is one of many travelers worried the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) doesn't fully understand the threat of the Ebola virus. His comments came earlier Thursday   before the White House said it is still against putting in place a travel ban on West African countries.Meanwhile   the CDC is reaching out to 132 people who were on Frontier Airlines Flight 1143 with Amber Vinson   the second Ebola-stricken Texas nurse. Vinson arrived in Ohio on Friday Oct. 10 and returned to Dallas Monday night. On Tuesday   she was diagnosed with a fever and later tested positive for Ebola.Frontier Airlines has since taken the Airbus A320 out of service. The plane was ferried back to Frontier's base in Denver   where it was cleaned. The airline also replaced air filters and some of the seat covers and carpeting on the plane.Frontier CEO David Siegel said   "These extraordinary actions went beyond CDC recommendations. These steps were taken out of concern for the safety of our customers and employees."Most passengers we spoke to had no complaints about Frontier or how it responded to the Ebola crisis. They did not have as much confidence in the CDC."The CDC is mishandling this  " Greg Powell said. "They didn't have a grip on this from the start   they had a slow handle on this   so that is what I am concerned about. How many more people are out there that have been exposed?"It's that fear of the unknown that worries people like Esther Viets. She was waiting at the Dallas Ft. Worth Airport to pick up a relative."I don't feel safe to fly. I'm not going to fly. Like I said   I don't even feel comfortable being the airport right now  " she said.Passenger Brittany Wilson sounded a similar note. As she checked bags for a flight from Dallas to Atlanta   she wore a surgical mask around her neck. It was another layer of protection she planned to wear during her flight."You can't be too cautious   so I would just rather protect myself as well as I can   so I just decided to wear it  " she said. "I just feel as though it is something that they are not telling us."The CDC has been working to assure the public that a widespread outbreak of Ebola is unlikely. On Thursday   the agency's Dr. Thomas Frieden said   "There is zero doubt in my mind unless there's a mutation there will not be a large-scale outbreak in the U.S."",negative

This compares to pre-tax income of $41 million for the full year 2007.-- JetBlue is evaluating the tax deductibility of the special charge   but has not yet finalized the amount given the technical nature of the issue. As a result   today JetBlue is only reporting its pre-tax results. Once the tax treatment for this special charge is finalized   JetBlue will report its net results in its Annual Report on Form 10-K   which will be filed in mid-February."While we are disappointed to report a loss   I am very proud of what JetBlue accomplished in 2008  " said Dave Barger   JetBlue's CEO. "Against the backdrop of record fuel prices and unprecedented economic challenges   we effectively managed our capacity and strengthened our network. We also made significant progress in our efforts to further enhance the JetBlue experience for our customers. JetBlue's industry-leading unit revenue growth throughout the year reflects the outstanding work of our crewmembers."Operational Performance Operating revenues for the fourth quarter totaled $811 million   representing growth of 9.8% over operating revenues of $739 million in the fourth quarter of 2007.

For the full year 2008   JetBlue's CASM   excluding fuel   increased 8.7% to 5.94 cents. Fuel Hedging JetBlue hedged approximately 24% of its fuel consumption during the fourth quarter   resulting in a realized fuel price of $2.67 per gallon   a 14.0% increase over fourth quarter 2007 realized fuel price of $2.34. JetBlue recorded $58 million in losses on fuel hedges that settled during the fourth quarter. Due to the rapid decline in fuel prices during the fourth quarter   JetBlue modified its fuel hedge portfolio   effectively minimizing fuel hedging losses and cash collateral requirements related to further oil price declines. At the end of the fourth quarter   JetBlue had posted approximately $117 million in cash collateral with fuel hedge counterparties related to its 2009 fuel hedge contracts. As of December 31   2008   JetBlue had hedged approximately 8% of its projected fuel requirements for 2009. JetBlue expects an average price per gallon of fuel   including the impact of hedges   of $2.07 in the first quarter and $1.99 for the full year 2009.

Balance Sheet Update JetBlue ended the fourth quarter with $561 million in cash and cash equivalents. In addition   JetBlue had $258 million of auction rate securities   net of impairment losses   at the end of the quarter. JetBlue recorded a $53 million accounting charge in the fourth quarter to reflect a decline in the market value of some of its auction rate securities. The accompanying financial tables contain further information regarding this impairment charge. "We strengthened our balance sheet in 2008 by paying down almost $700 million of debt   and we will continue to take steps to bolster our liquidity  " said Barnes.

"Worried about Zika? Here's how to cancel that trip As worries about Zika virus mount   pregnant travelers may find they have limited leeway to reschedule   relocate or cancel vacation plans. Last week the World Health Organization declared Zika a public health emergency   noting the virus's suspected ties to microcephaly and other neurological complications in newborns. The Centers for Disease Control have issued Level 2 warnings for 30 areas where the disease is being actively transmitted — including Puerto Rico   Mexico   Jamaica and the U.S. Virgin Islands — urging travelers to take extra precautions. Pregnant women in any trimester   the CDC warns   should "consider postponing travel to any area where Zika virus transmission is ongoing." Changing babymoon plans   however   isn't always easy or cheap. Travelers' first step should be to check the cancellation and change policies for hotel   airfare and other travel components   said Jason Clampet   co-founder of travel site Skift.com. You may not even need to mention Zika fears; many hotels   for example   still allow penalty-free cancellation with just a few days' notice   he said. No luck? See if there's a Zika-specific policy in place. Most major domestic airlines and several cruise lines have said they are relaxing change policies for pregnant travelers with existing reservations to an affected region. Eligible travelers may be able to reschedule a trip   pick a new destination or receive a refund. American   Delta   JetBlue   Southwest   United and Virgin America all have Zika travel alerts. On the cruise side   Royal Caribbean and Norwegian are among those that have posted waiver details. Call customer service to plead your case even if a travel provider doesn't have a waiver on offer and the return policy seems ironclad. Reps may have some leeway to offer a refund or change waiver on a case-by-case basis   Clampet urged. "Humans can always make choices at these travel brands  " he said. If you bought travel insurance   check to see if your policy will kick in to cover nonrefundable costs of rescheduling or canceling your trip — but don't count on it. "In general   policies don't cover something that would just be a fear of travel  " said Megan Freedman   executive director of the U.S. Travel Insurance Association. Worries that you'll contract Zika aren't covered   even with the CDC's travel warning. There are a few exceptions. Travelers who paid extra for cancel-for-any-reason coverage are likely to find they can still back out. A few policies also allow for trip cancellation if you became pregnant after purchasing the insurance and   as a result of the pregnancy   no longer want to take the trip   said Rachael Taft   a spokeswoman for comparison site Squaremouth. Keep all those considerations in mind if you're planning a trip and think Zika could at some point be a concern for you   such as if you're trying to become pregnant or are taking a babymoon to a destination where Zika could soon spread. Check to see how far in advance and under what circumstances you can cancel   said Clampet   and keep in mind that a particular company's policy may vary based on whether you booked directly or through a third-party travel site.",negative
