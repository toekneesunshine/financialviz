"Is American Airlines Making The Most Of Its Increased Cash Flows? Sustained weakness in global crude oil prices continues to create an upsurge in the profits of the majority of the US airlines. The top six US airlines – American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL)   United Continental (NYSE:UAL)   Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL)   Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV)   Alaska Air Group (NYSE:ALK) and JetBlue Airways (NYSE:JBLU) – delivered a GAAP net profit of $5.4 billion in the June 2015 quarter   which is 62% higher compared to the profits earned in the same quarter last year. Since the timing of the rebound in oil prices is unknown   US airlines are taking all possible measures to judiciously utilize the excess cash flows to mitigate the sensitivity of their earnings to the oil prices to some extent. These measures include re-fleeting of aircraft   reducing debt obligations   and returning value to the shareholders. In this article   we will analyze the strategies being adopted by American Airlines and determine if the airline is making the best use of the extra cash at its disposal. Our price estimate for American Airlines stands at $48 per share   about 20% ahead of its current market price.Let’s begin by looking at American Airlines’ current financial status. The world’s largest airline (by traffic) reported a net income of $1.7 billion in the second quarter of 2015   almost double the profits generated a year ago((American Airlines Second Quarter 10Q filing   24th July 2015   www.aa.com)). This huge jump in profits was driven primarily by the airline’s no hedging policy   which resulted in fuel cost savings of more than $1 billion. Consequently   the airline generated operating cash flows of $4.8 billion in the first six months   which are expected to grow even higher in the later half of the year. However   the airline currently has long-term debt of close to $19 billion on its balance sheet. This translates into a debt to capitalization rate of over 42%   which is much higher than the industry average. Thus   the most logical use of the extra cash generated during the year should be to pay down the airline’s long term debt. However   the airline does not seem to be taking that path.On the contrary   the Fort Worth-based airline is using its cash flows to overhaul its existing fleet of aircraft. The airline expects to spend close to $5.4 billion on new aircraft in 2015   which should be easily funded through its annual operating cash flows and some incremental debt   if required. Though it may appear irrational at first to take on more debt to finance newer aircraft   things become clearer if we take a closer look. The airline had ordered several Airbus A320-neo aircraft before filing for bankruptcy in 2011. However   it has been delaying in taking the delivery of these planes due to a variety of reasons. But now   with stronger cash flows   the airline is set to replace its older and smaller planes with bigger and more fuel-efficient planes. These planes will not only enable the airline to expand its capacity to fight the increasing competition   but will also improve the airline’s operational efficiency   that will reflect on its margins in the long term. However   that does not resolve the issues related to a highly levered balance sheet. American Airline is fully aware of the concerns that an excess leverage can cause and as a result   the airline has been proactively working towards reducing it. The legacy carrier has paid down over $3 billion of its high cost debt since its merger with US Airways in December 2013 and has refinanced the remaining debt at lower rates. For example   the airline has raised a new debt financing of $1.7 billion with a blended rate of 3.7%   which is very low compared to the industry standards. Thus   despite having a huge amount of debt on its books   the interest obligation of the airline has actually gone down due to the lower interest rates. This implies that the airline is quick enough to take advantage of any attractive opportunity which can prove to be beneficial in the long term. Apart from re-fleeting   American Airlines is investing its cash flows on repurchasing its own shares from the market. In the second quarter   the airline repurchased 17.3 million shares worth $753 million((American Airlines Second Quarter 10Q filing   24th July 2015   www.aa.com)). Further   the legacy carrier authorized a $2 billion share repurchase program to be completed by 2016   in addition to an existing $2 billion repurchase program approved in January 2015.  In addition to this   the airline has been paying a quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share over the last four quarters. In all   the airline has returned approximately $1.1 billion to its shareholders in the first half of 2015. This indicates the airline’s willingness to share its growing profits with its shareholders   which is likely to reinforce investor confidence in the airline.To conclude we would say that while the high debt on American Airlines’ books is likely to raise investor concerns   the airline knows what it is doing and its strategy is likely to bear fruits in the long term.",negative
"Zika virus worries weigh on the travel industry Tourism and travel-related stocks have taken a hit from worries surrounding the Zika virus   and though many were moving higher Monday   most are still trading below their levels from a week ago. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it has confirmed that 31 Americans have become infected   all after traveling to one of the 24 countries or territories with the outbreaks. The region hardest hit by the mosquito-borne virus is the Caribbean   Central and South America   where several major U.S.-based cruise line   airline and hotel chains operate. Shares in travel-related companies regained some lost ground on Friday   and were mixed Monday   but are still mostly below their levels from before the virus began gaining attention. They're also underperforming the wider market. "Cruise line stocks have underperformed the market by quite a bit — and so have travel group stocks in general because of concerns about Zika  " Wells Fargo Securities analyst Tim Conder said late last week. Among cruise operator stocks   Norwegian Cruise Line dropped more than 5 percent last week   Royal Caribbean fell 4 percent   and Carnival declined nearly 3 percent. Even Walt Disney   operator of the Disney Cruise Line   slipped more 1 percent for the week."The Caribbean is the top market for all of these companies   especially Norwegian Cruises  " said C. Patrick Scholes   a lodging and leisure equity analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphey. He added that the exposure for Disney shouldn't be as significant because "Disney Cruise Line is a small part of a giant corporation."Shares of Norwegian were nearly 3 percent higher Monday   but that company and most other travel shares still had not reclaimed the losses they experienced last week. Within the airline sector   Delta Air Lines lost about 6 percent last week   American Airlines Group dipped nearly 3 percent and JetBlue Airways gave back about 1 percent. Hotel stocks weren't spared: Hilton Worldwide lost nearly 3 percent   Marriott International fell about 2 percent and Starwood Hotels and Choice Hotels International each declined about 1 percent. In Brazil alone   an estimated 1.5 million people have been infected   according to the World Health Organization. "There is a concern that the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro   Brazil will result in wider spread of the disease globally  " Cowen & Co. analyst Helane Becker said in a research note Thursday. The WHO forecasts up to 4 million people in the Americas are at risk of getting infected   and the CDC is warning pregnant women to consider postponing travel to the areas where the virus transmission is ongoing. The virus has been linked to microcephaly   a serious birth defect. Industry analysts said it is too early to gauge the impact for travel-related companies but noted many of the airline and cruise lines are offering credits or refunds to expectant mothers."As of yet we haven't see a material change in bookings  " American Airlines Group President Scott Kirby said Friday during the carrier's fourth-quarter earnings conference call. JetBlue's executive vice president of commercial and planning   Marty St. George   told analysts Thursday that "we've really seen no measurable impact either to advance bookings or customer refunds." According to Conder   the worst-case scenario for the cruise segment is that booking demand gets cut by about 6 percent   or 1.4 million travelers out of about 24 million. He said major cruise operators generally prohibit women who are 24 or more weeks pregnant to board   so "that would cut the estimate by a third."Added the analyst   "We're not diminishing the seriousness of Zika or how it's spreading   but if you compare it to Ebola the primary risk appears to be women who are pregnant. Ebola is a much more dire situation for anyone. Even if it does spread — and probably will — efforts being marshaled will help contain it."",negative
"Worried fliers wear masks as precaution against Ebola Corbin Fawley knew he stood out on his Frontier Airlines flight from Denver to Dallas. But that was fine with him. Fawley wore a surgical mask and rubber gloves to give himself what he considered an extra level of protection against the Ebola virus   even though it's not airborne. Instead   it's spread through contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person who is showing symptoms of the virus."I am not losing anything by putting on gloves and a mask. It is just an extra precaution  " Fawley said from the baggage claim area."How can they [the federal government] significantly regulate something like this? I mean   that's why I was taking matters into my own hands to protect myself from it  " he said.Fawley is one of many travelers worried the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) doesn't fully understand the threat of the Ebola virus. His comments came earlier Thursday   before the White House said it is still against putting in place a travel ban on West African countries.Meanwhile   the CDC is reaching out to 132 people who were on Frontier Airlines Flight 1143 with Amber Vinson   the second Ebola-stricken Texas nurse. Vinson arrived in Ohio on Friday Oct. 10 and returned to Dallas Monday night. On Tuesday   she was diagnosed with a fever and later tested positive for Ebola.Frontier Airlines has since taken the Airbus A320 out of service. The plane was ferried back to Frontier's base in Denver   where it was cleaned. The airline also replaced air filters and some of the seat covers and carpeting on the plane.Frontier CEO David Siegel said   "These extraordinary actions went beyond CDC recommendations. These steps were taken out of concern for the safety of our customers and employees."Most passengers we spoke to had no complaints about Frontier or how it responded to the Ebola crisis. They did not have as much confidence in the CDC."The CDC is mishandling this  " Greg Powell said. "They didn't have a grip on this from the start   they had a slow handle on this   so that is what I am concerned about. How many more people are out there that have been exposed?"It's that fear of the unknown that worries people like Esther Viets. She was waiting at the Dallas Ft. Worth Airport to pick up a relative."I don't feel safe to fly. I'm not going to fly. Like I said   I don't even feel comfortable being the airport right now  " she said.Passenger Brittany Wilson sounded a similar note. As she checked bags for a flight from Dallas to Atlanta   she wore a surgical mask around her neck. It was another layer of protection she planned to wear during her flight."You can't be too cautious   so I would just rather protect myself as well as I can   so I just decided to wear it  " she said. "I just feel as though it is something that they are not telling us."The CDC has been working to assure the public that a widespread outbreak of Ebola is unlikely. On Thursday   the agency's Dr. Thomas Frieden said   "There is zero doubt in my mind unless there's a mutation there will not be a large-scale outbreak in the U.S."",negative
"JetBlue Announces Q4 2009 and Full Year 2008 Pre-Tax Results NEW YORK   Jan. 29 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- JetBlue Airways Corporation (Nasdaq: JBLU) today reported its pre-tax results for the fourth quarter and full year 2008:-- Pre-tax loss of $49 million in the fourth quarter   which includes a special non-cash charge of $53 million related to the valuation of JetBlue's auction rate securities. Excluding this special charge   JetBlue reported pre-tax income for the quarter of $4 million. This compares to a pre-tax loss of $3 million in the year-ago period.-- For the full year 2008   JetBlue reported a pre-tax loss of $76 million. Excluding the special charge   JetBlue reported a pre-tax loss of $23 million. This compares to pre-tax income of $41 million for the full year 2007.-- JetBlue is evaluating the tax deductibility of the special charge   but has not yet finalized the amount given the technical nature of the issue. As a result   today JetBlue is only reporting its pre-tax results. Once the tax treatment for this special charge is finalized   JetBlue will report its net results in its Annual Report on Form 10-K   which will be filed in mid-February."While we are disappointed to report a loss   I am very proud of what JetBlue accomplished in 2008  " said Dave Barger   JetBlue's CEO. "Against the backdrop of record fuel prices and unprecedented economic challenges   we effectively managed our capacity and strengthened our network. We also made significant progress in our efforts to further enhance the JetBlue experience for our customers. JetBlue's industry-leading unit revenue growth throughout the year reflects the outstanding work of our crewmembers."Operational Performance Operating revenues for the fourth quarter totaled $811 million   representing growth of 9.8% over operating revenues of $739 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. For the full year   operating revenues totaled $3.39 billion   representing growth of 19.2% over operating revenues of $2.84 billion for the full year 2007. For the fourth quarter   revenue passenger miles decreased 5.0% year-over-year to 5.9 billion on a capacity decrease of 7.4%   resulting in a fourth quarter load factor of 78.6%   an increase of 2.0 points year over year. Yield per passenger mile in the fourth quarter was 12.23 cents   up 12.3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. Passenger revenue per available seat mile (PRASM) for the fourth quarter 2008 increased 15.3% year-over-year to 9.62 cents. For the full year 2008   PRASM increased 14.0% year over year. Operating expenses for the quarter increased 7.5%   or $53 million   over the prior year period. JetBlue's operating expense per available seat mile (CASM) for the fourth quarter increased 16.1% year-over-year to 10.14 cents. Excluding fuel   CASM increased 17.2% to 6.42 cents. For the full year 2008   JetBlue's CASM   excluding fuel   increased 8.7% to 5.94 cents. Fuel Hedging JetBlue hedged approximately 24% of its fuel consumption during the fourth quarter   resulting in a realized fuel price of $2.67 per gallon   a 14.0% increase over fourth quarter 2007 realized fuel price of $2.34. JetBlue recorded $58 million in losses on fuel hedges that settled during the fourth quarter. Due to the rapid decline in fuel prices during the fourth quarter   JetBlue modified its fuel hedge portfolio   effectively minimizing fuel hedging losses and cash collateral requirements related to further oil price declines. At the end of the fourth quarter   JetBlue had posted approximately $117 million in cash collateral with fuel hedge counterparties related to its 2009 fuel hedge contracts. As of December 31   2008   JetBlue had hedged approximately 8% of its projected fuel requirements for 2009. JetBlue expects an average price per gallon of fuel   including the impact of hedges   of $2.07 in the first quarter and $1.99 for the full year 2009. "We expect lower fuel prices will provide significant savings to JetBlue in 2009  " said Ed Barnes   JetBlue's CFO. Balance Sheet Update JetBlue ended the fourth quarter with $561 million in cash and cash equivalents. In addition   JetBlue had $258 million of auction rate securities   net of impairment losses   at the end of the quarter. JetBlue recorded a $53 million accounting charge in the fourth quarter to reflect a decline in the market value of some of its auction rate securities. The accompanying financial tables contain further information regarding this impairment charge. "We strengthened our balance sheet in 2008 by paying down almost $700 million of debt   and we will continue to take steps to bolster our liquidity  " said Barnes. "With minimal debt maturities in 2009   we believe JetBlue is very well positioned to successfully manage through this period of economic uncertainty and build for the future." First Quarter and Full Year Outlook Looking ahead   for the first quarter of 2009   JetBlue expects to report an operating margin between six and eight percent. Pre-tax margin for the quarter is expected to be between zero and two percent. PRASM is expected to increase between two and four percent year over year. RASM is expected to increase between five and seven percent year over year. CASM is expected to increase between zero and two percent over the year-ago period. Excluding fuel   CASM in the first quarter is expected to increase between 11 and 13 percent year over year. Capacity is expected to decrease between five and seven percent in the first quarter and stage length is expected to decrease roughly six percent over the same period last year.

"Worried about Zika? Here's how to cancel that trip As worries about Zika virus mount   pregnant travelers may find they have limited leeway to reschedule   relocate or cancel vacation plans. Last week the World Health Organization declared Zika a public health emergency   noting the virus's suspected ties to microcephaly and other neurological complications in newborns. The Centers for Disease Control have issued Level 2 warnings for 30 areas where the disease is being actively transmitted — including Puerto Rico   Mexico   Jamaica and the U.S. Virgin Islands — urging travelers to take extra precautions. Pregnant women in any trimester   the CDC warns   should "consider postponing travel to any area where Zika virus transmission is ongoing." Changing babymoon plans   however   isn't always easy or cheap. Travelers' first step should be to check the cancellation and change policies for hotel   airfare and other travel components   said Jason Clampet   co-founder of travel site Skift.com. You may not even need to mention Zika fears; many hotels   for example   still allow penalty-free cancellation with just a few days' notice   he said. No luck? See if there's a Zika-specific policy in place. Most major domestic airlines and several cruise lines have said they are relaxing change policies for pregnant travelers with existing reservations to an affected region. Eligible travelers may be able to reschedule a trip   pick a new destination or receive a refund. American   Delta   JetBlue   Southwest   United and Virgin America all have Zika travel alerts. On the cruise side   Royal Caribbean and Norwegian are among those that have posted waiver details. Call customer service to plead your case even if a travel provider doesn't have a waiver on offer and the return policy seems ironclad. Reps may have some leeway to offer a refund or change waiver on a case-by-case basis   Clampet urged. "Humans can always make choices at these travel brands  " he said. If you bought travel insurance   check to see if your policy will kick in to cover nonrefundable costs of rescheduling or canceling your trip — but don't count on it. "In general   policies don't cover something that would just be a fear of travel  " said Megan Freedman   executive director of the U.S. Travel Insurance Association. Worries that you'll contract Zika aren't covered   even with the CDC's travel warning. There are a few exceptions. Travelers who paid extra for cancel-for-any-reason coverage are likely to find they can still back out. A few policies also allow for trip cancellation if you became pregnant after purchasing the insurance and   as a result of the pregnancy   no longer want to take the trip   said Rachael Taft   a spokeswoman for comparison site Squaremouth. Keep all those considerations in mind if you're planning a trip and think Zika could at some point be a concern for you   such as if you're trying to become pregnant or are taking a babymoon to a destination where Zika could soon spread. Check to see how far in advance and under what circumstances you can cancel   said Clampet   and keep in mind that a particular company's policy may vary based on whether you booked directly or through a third-party travel site.",negative
"Airline stocks tank on DOJ investigation report Airline stocks are tanking Wednesday afternoon after a report surfaced that the Department of Justice has begun a probe of its revenue management practices. The Department of Justice said it is investigating “possible unlawful coordination” among some airlines. The Associated Press   citing internal documents   says the collusion among major airlines involved limited available seats to keep airfares high. Shares of American Airlines (AAL) fell 2.8% to $38.80. Delta Air Lines (DAL) fell 2% to $40.27. United Continental Holdings (UAL) fell 2.5% to $51.69. Southwest Airlines (LUV) fell 1.4% to $32.62. JetBlue Airways (JBLU) fell 3.4% to $20.06.The DOJ’s civil antitrust investigation is focusing its investigation on whether airlines “illegally signaled to each other how quickly they would add new flights   routes and extra seats  ” the AP report said. The DOJ has already demanded copies of all communications among the airlines   analysts and shareholders. In recent years   U.S. airlines have cut back on their capacity   leading to fewer seats and higher airfares. “We are confident that the Justice Department will find what we know to be true  ” industry trade group Airlines for America said in a statement. “Our members compete vigorously every day   and the traveling public has been the beneficiary   as the DOT’s own data shows that domestic fares are down in 2015.” “It is customers who decide pricing   voting every day with their wallets on what they value and are willing to pay for. Because there so many options among air carriers   with low cost carriers being among the fastest-growing segment   more people can afford air travel   as 222 million people are projected to fly this summer   including a record number of international travelers and the highest number of people flying domestically since the recession  ” it said.",negative
"Why JetBlue, Seadrill Partners, and Container Store Group Slumped Today Stocks performed poorly to finish the week, as continued weakness in the commodities markets worried investors that the moves are signaling a potential global recession. Some hoped to see a year-end Santa Claus rally start to take shape, but many market participants think that the nearly seven-year-old bull market is showing signs that it could come to an end. Some of the worst-performing stocks on Friday were JetBlue Airways (NASDAQ:JBLU), Seadrill Partners (NYSE:SDLP), and Container Store Group (NYSE:TCS). JetBlue fell 8% after announcing its monthly traffic numbers for November on Thursday afternoon. Traffic figures jumped more than 14% from year-ago levels, as capacity increased by 10.7%, and load factors climbed by 2.5 percentage points. However, JetBlue said that in the fourth quarter, the airline expects its passenger revenue per available seat mile, a key metric in the industry, to fall between 2% and 3%. The company blamed the calendar effect of the timing of December holidays by day of the week for some of the decline. JetBlue also said that a lack of winter weather contributed to a higher completion factor than expected, which somewhat counterintuitively had a negative impact on its key operating metric. Seadrill Partners plunged 17%, representing one of the worst performances on a day in which most energy companies fell sharply in concert. The continued downward move in oil prices into the mid-$30s hasn't done any company in the business any favors, but Seadrill Partners is particularly vulnerable to low oil prices because the more-expensive process of drilling in deep water requires higher commodity prices to make production economically viable. Seadrill Partners has thus far not made any moves to cut its dividend, but many now believe that it's just a matter of time before the company has to join its many peers by reducing or suspending its payout to conserve cash through the tough times in the industry. Finally, Container Store Group dropped nearly 20%. The organizational products retailer got a downgrade from analysts at Merrill Lynch, cutting the company all the way from buy to underperform. The firm cut its price target on Container Store stock by more than half, to $9 per share, and investors dutifully sent the market price for shares down beyond that level. Despite having shown signs of strong potential in the run-up to its initial public offering in late 2013, Container Store hasn't been able to generate the growth that investors had expected. The company only managed to grow revenue by 1.2% in its most-recent quarter, and although currency impacts have played a role in holding it back, Container Store has also felt it necessary to invest heavily in major strategic initiatives that it hopes will put the retailer back on a growth path in the near future. Until that happens, though, shareholders might well remain skeptical about Container Store's staying power in a tough environment for the retail industry more broadly.",negative

"Dow loses gains for the year; transports off 2%  Cashin says: Beware Triple Crown indicator	Cashin says: Beware Triple Crown indicator U.S. stocks closed near session lows on Monday as investors weighed multi-month highs in bond yields amid greater expectations of tightening following Friday's strong jobs report. (Tweet This) The Dow Jones industrial average closed down about 80 points   posting losses of 0.32 percent year-to-date. "I think everybody's a little unsettled about the way U.S. and European bond markets sold off in the last week  " said David Kelly   chief global strategist at J.P. Morgan Funds. Analysts noted relatively less volatility in bond and currency markets in Monday trade. The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury yield held slightly lower at 2.39 percent. The U.S. dollar pared recent gains   down about one percent against major world currencies with the euro rising to $1.1287. The stronger greenback has weighed on corporate earnings. On Friday   a surge in bond yields to multi-month highs on a strong jobs report pressured equities   with U.S. stocks closing narrowly mixed. Nonfarm payrolls for May beat expectations with the addition of 280  000 jobs. Analysts also cheered a greater-than-forecast 8 cent increase in hourly wages and a 5.5 percent unemployment rate.

"Grab a barf bag! Airline stocks plunge Fasten your seat belts and stow your tray tables   investors. The major airline stocks hit a big pocket of turbulence Wednesday. Shares of Southwest (LUV)   American (AAL)   United (UAL)   Delta (DAL)   JetBlue (JBLU) and Spirit (SAVE) were all down between 6% and 8%. An airline ETF that debuted last month   U.S. Global Jets (JETS)   fell nearly 5%. It wasn't entirely clear why the group suddenly lost altitude. But airline stocks are no longer the Wall Street darlings that they were for the past few years. All of the big airlines -- with the notable exception of JetBlue and Alaska Air (ALK) -- are down at least 10% this year. After an epic run over the past few years   the airline rally may simply be running out of steam. It's no longer a secret that airlines are much healthier than they were years ago following a round of mergers. Investors could be channeling Charles Grodin's character from "Midnight Run" when he was pretending to be too scared to fly. "These things go down! It's too big! It can't go up!" But there are growing concerns that the best days are behind the airline industry. OIl prices have gone up. Even though several airlines have already talked about the billions of dollars in fuel savings they expect this year   oil prices are now heading back up and are near $60 a barrel. Goldman Sachs analysts have predicted that crude prices will retreat again -- perhaps to $45 by the fall. But for now   investors appear to be focusing more on the current trend. Peak margins? Comments from airline industry executives on Tuesday may be spooking investors too. Speaking at an industry conference hosted by brokerage firm Wolfe Research   a boutique that focuses on transportation   Southwest chief financial officer Tammy Romo said that this year may be a "peak" for the airline industry's growth. Romo said that longer-term   growth in the industry should be more in line with that of the economy. The airlines have thrived recently even though the U.S. economy has been relatively sluggish. At the same conference   American president Scott Kirby said profit margins in 2016 will probably not be as high as this year. Reverting to their old ways? One of the questions that came up repeatedly during the Wolfe conference was whether or not the airline industry had added too much capacity lately. That could be a big problem for the airlines if the economy cools further than it already did in the first quarter. A key reason why airlines have done so well over the past few years is because they were more disciplined and were not adding too many flights and lowering prices at the expense of profits. United CFO John Rainey said at the Wolfe conference that his airline had cut capacity while oil prices were falling. And he added that he thinks consumers are now more willing to pay for things like added leg room and other on-flight extras. In other words   he doesn't think the industry leaders are making the same mistakes they made in the past. But Alaska Air CEO Brad Tilden suggested that the airline industry is still more on the commodity end of the spectrum. Kirby was blunt. He said that airlines can't stick their head in the sand and pretend that consumers won't fly with discount carriers like Spirit because they have less legroom. "A big segment of our customer base shops on price   and we need to compete with those customers as well  " he said. That sounds an awful lot like the start of a new round of fare wars. Great news for travelers. Terrible news for airline investors.",negative

“It’s no secret that America’s airports are decaying  crumbling and in the words of Donald Trump  resemble those of third world nations. According to the most recent report card from the American Society of Civil Engineers  on a letter scale of A to F conditions at America’s airports received a grade of D. Congress can and should address this issue by eliminating the federal airline tax and allowing as well as municipalities to collect sufficient funds to modernize their airports. Such a move would eliminate Washington as the middleman and ensure more taxpayer dollars are going directly toward building airports and updating existing ones for the modern age. The big three domestic airlines – Delta Air Lines  United Continental Holdings  Airlines and American Airlines Group – are all expected to deliver some of the best earnings in years according to Wall Street analyst estimates collected by Bloomberg and other sources as are JetBlue Airways and Virgin America (VA). While some of that will be due to lower fuel costs  revenues are also climbing due to more airline passenger travel and “ancillary revenues.”According to Ed Perkins of the Chicago Tribune  U.S. legacy airlines will make a good percentage of their profit off of “ancillary revenues” that include revenues from activities that are outside the scope of transporting passengers to and from the destinations and points of departure. Examples include things like commissions for hotel referrals  checked bag fees  which incidentally  are not taxed as profit by the IRS.  If you compare your total airline travel costs over the last few years  you would notice a pronounced increase in the ancillary components. The Chicago Times story reports that fees collected from ancillary activities for “Alaska  American  Delta  Hawaiian  Southwest and United — will amount to $18 billion  or about 11 percent of total revenues ” up more than twice the 4.6 percent of total revenues in 2010 according to data published by IdeaWorks. The story goes on to cite that checked bag fees provide 20% of the total revenues.  In essence  government tax policy has encouraged travelers to be nickeled and dimed to death. In the coming months  Congress is expected to begin debating legislation titled the “Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Authorization” bill  which offers an opportunity to change federal aviation tax policy.  House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Bill Schuster (R-Pa.) could free market forces in the aviation travel industry by pushing reform of the aviation tax system. Depending on the outcome of the FAA bill  we could have a tax system that does not incentivize the airlines to hike ancillary fees  like your bag and flight change fees  but would still allow for airport upgrades and improvements. What are some of the items that if reformed would help restore free market forces to the air travel economy? First is the Anti-Head Tax Act that was passed in 1973 and prevents an airport from charging a passenger for departing or arriving at a specific airport.  Next are federal domestic flight taxes that include a 7.5% tax on the price of the airline ticket and a $4.00 flight segment tax  plus a September 11th security tax of $5.60 and a Passenger Facility Charge that the airports are allowed to charge up to $4.50.  Applying that to the U.S domestic average itinerary fare of $391 in 2014 per the Bureau of Transportation Statistics  equates to more than $43. By itself  one may not think that adds up to much  but factor in the more than 662.8 million passengers that few in 2014 alone  and it those fees quickly add up to big bucks. A repeal of the Anti-Head tax in conjunction with a repeal  or severely cutting  the many taxes that are built into every ticket a passenger purchases would serve two important purposes.  First  it would allow local airports to set up a taxation system to pay for upgrades so that our nation’s decrepit airports could be made great again.  Right now airlines are allowed to collect at $4.50 Passenger Facility Charge  but they are also supposed to get resources from the federal Airport Improvement Program funded by the massive federal taxes imposed on every fare.  Much of the money is wasted and not efficiently given to airports and you need merely to look at LaGuardia Airport as a prime example.Presidential candidate Donald Trump frequently makes fun of LaGuardia Airport and calls it a “third world dump” because it is so run down  and that is just one of like many our nations’ 18 762 airport facilities used for general aviation purposes.  Restoring authority to local airports to collect fees on travelers would take the federal government middleman out of the calculation.  Right now they have to beg the FAA to remit money when they want to upgrade a facility. Second  taking most  if not all  of the high taxes and fees off the ticket price would remove the incentive for the airlines to use untaxed ancillary fees to make huge profits.  High federal ticket taxes are one of the reasons why airlines resort to massive fees on checked bags and ticket changes in part because those are untaxed activities.  Radically lower taxes on ticket prices will help consumers and the airlines in the short and long term because lower costs should help spur more airline travel and likely drive additional spending at airports. When Congress takes up legislation to authorize FAA programs they need to consider reforms that will provide a stimulus  not a hindrance to the industry.  Speaker Paul Ryan and House Transportation Committee Chairman Bill Schuster have an opportunity to change policy that will help upgrade airports  lower the interference of the federal government in how much you consumers pay to fly and make sure that our airports are no longer holdovers from the last century.”,positive
“JetBlue Airways more than doubled its fourth quarter profit  compared to a year earlier  as lower fuel costs and a surge of new customers bolstered the bottom line.The airline's net income swung from $88 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 to $190 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Full-year net income rose from $401 million to $677 million.Operating revenue increased 10.2% for the quarter to $1.59 billion and 10.3% for the year to $6.42 billion. The company posted earnings per share of 56 cents  besting the S&P Capital IQconsensus analyst estimate of 51 cents. JetBlue shares (JBLU) surged 5.9% to $22.50 in pre-market trading. “We posted another strong quarter  producing above industry average revenue performance and running a safe and reliable operation " JetBlue CEO Robin Hayessaid in a statement. "I want to thank all our 18 000 crewmembers for their terrific efforts throughout the year." The airline is getting a substantive boost from the plunging price of oil. The average price of jet fuel the company paid in the fourth quarter was $1.68 per gallon  reflecting a 37.8% decline from a year earlier. Despite $33 million in losses on fuel hedging in the fourth quarter  the company is positioned to benefit substantially from lower fuel prices in the first and second quarters of 2016  when it has no fuel hedges in place. An investment in additional capacity paid off during the quarter  too  as revenue passenger miles — a gauge of how far customers paid to travel — rose 12.4%  outpacing the 10.4% capacity increase.”,positive
“Southwest Airlines and JetBlue are the best U.S.-based frequent-flyer programs when it comes to award seat availability  a new survey has concluded. According to The Wall Street Journal  consulting firm IdeaWorks surveyed 25 airlines both domestic and international  and found that two seats at the lowest level of each program were available for 77 percent of the booking queries made this year. That is a 3 percent increase over 2015.  "Overall  I think the consumer is being better served than the year before " said Jay Sorensen  president of IdeaWorks. "This survey reflects the fact that airlines can’t afford to take their customers for granted. 21st century consumers are savvy and plugged-in " added Switchfly CEO Daniel Farrar  who worked in tandem with IdeaWorks to issue the seventh annual Switchfly Reward Seat Availability Survey.  American Airlines' AAdvantage program ranked last among U.S. airlines  with 56 percent seat availability.  "Their loyalty program needs attention " Sorensen commented.  The survey concluded that frequent flyers are  on average  best served by value-oriented airlines. Southwest definitely fits that description  as it does not offer assigned seating  enabling it to fill planes to capacity more easily  which in turn drives down prices. The lack of assigned seats also improves seat availability  helping it move to the top of the annual list. Combined  the top six U.S. and international value-oriented airlines offered 87 percent seat availability  compared to 72 percent offered by more traditional airlines. The survey found that seat availability also fluctuated seasonally. It was best in September and October  and worst in July. “,positive
“Southwest soars: Investors love LUV Lower fuel prices = record profits for the airline industry. Southwest  United and Alaska Air all reported strong earnings Thursday. It was the best second quarter ever for Alaska Air (ALK) and highest profit for any quarter atUnited (UAL) and Southwest (LUV). Southwest said it saved $500 million on fuel costs in the quarter. United saved nearly $1 billion. Investors  for the most part  loved the news. Shares of Southwest soared 5% while United was up 3%. Alaska Air's stock did pull back though. But the U.S. Global Jets (JETS) exchange-traded fund  which owns these three airlines as well as shares of Delta (DAL)  JetBlue (JBLU)  Spirit (SAVE) and Virgin America (VA)  was higher. Delta reported results last week. American (AAL) and Spirit will report their earnings Friday while JetBlue and Virgin America are on tap to release their latest results next week. The airline industry is now in much healthier shape than arguably any other time in its history. The plunge in oil prices since last summer has only made things better. A wave of airline mergers has led to more rational pricing strategies by the big carriers. The days of huge fare wars seem to be over. That's great news for investors  even if it's bad news for travelers. Many airlines have boosted revenue though by adding on higher fees and surcharges for things like checking bags and pre-printing boarding passes. Still  there have been some concerns on Wall Street lately that the good times for the industry may soon be over. JetBlue and Alaska Air are the only two major airline stocks up this year. The rest have fallen on fears that profit margins may be close to peaking. Fuel prices  while still down sharply  are up from their lows. And the Department of Justice has accused Southwest  Delta  United and American of possibly colluding to keep capacity growth down. Doing so could keep fares higher than they otherwise would be. There have been some calls for airlines to cut ticket prices because fuel costs have dropped so dramatically. But Southwest said that its average ticket price dropped 3.4% from a year ago to $157.51. United and Delta also both reported declines in a key airline metric known as passenger revenue which accounts for fares and fees. The strong dollar is partly to blame for this though  since it reduces the value of what foreign travelers pay to fly. Still  the airline industry may be in a rare state of cruising altitude for both investors and passengers. Profits are climbing and consumers can still find some good bargains.”,positive
“JetBlue earnings climb 18.5% on cheaper fuel  growing Mint JetBlue Airways reported an 18.5% rise in second-quarter earnings Tuesday  riding low fuel prices that have benefited the airline industry for a year and growth in its premium Mint service for transcontinental flights. The New York-based airline reported $180 million in net income for April  May and June  up from $152 million for the same period a year earlier. Revenues were up 2% in the second quarter  to $1.6 billion. And fuel costs declined 26%  to $274 million  compared to a year earlier. At 53 cents of earnings per diluted share  the results beat estimates of 49 cents per share  according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Jim Corridore  an analyst with S&P Global Market Intelligence  maintained a "strong buy" recommendation because pressures on unit revenues are expected to lessen after the summer. CEO Robin Hayes called it “another great quarter.” Looking forward  he said the airline would continue to grow its transcontinental market with the Mint premium service stimulating demand and improving revenue for each available mile flown by 20% since its introduction in 2014. “Mint has surpassed our expectations on every customer and financial measure ” Hayes said. JetBlue announced Tuesday it would expand Mint by amending a purchase agreement with Airbus to bring 30 more A321 aircraft into its fleet over seven years. Of those  15 A321 aircraft will begin arriving next year. Another 15 A321neo aircraft will start arriving in 2020. The airline had announced earlier this year it would expand Mint to  Fort Lauderdale  Las Vegas  San Diego and Seattle  while also increasing options from New York's John F. Kennedy airport  Boston and Los Angeles. Once those flights have launched  JetBlue will have more than 70 Mint flights daily from the East Coast  West Coast andCaribbean. JetBlue continues to grow. The airline increased its capacity 11.1% for the quarter and had a 10.3% increase in the miles that passengers paid to fly  at 11.6 billion. But the planes flew slightly less full than a year earlier  a 0.6 point drop to 85%. The yield for flying each passenger a mile fell nearly 10%  to 12.87 cents.”,positive
“Why Is JetBlue Airways (JBLU) a Must-Add for Your Portfolio? On Oct 4  2016  we issued an updated research report on JetBlue Airways Corporation JBLU . The Long Island City  NY-based low-cost carrier currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)  indicating that it will outperform the broader market in the near term. We are impressed by the renewable jet fuel purchase agreement between JetBlue Airways and SG Preston last month. Under this deal  which is aimed at reducing carbon emissions  JetBlue is expected to purchase over 33 million gallons of blended fuel per year from SG Preston over a period of 10 years. This deal is by far the largest  binding commitment for hydro-processed esters and fatty acids (HEFA)-based renewable fuel purchase over a long term by an airline company. We are also impressed by the company's bullish guidance for total revenue per available seat mile (RASM: a key measure of unit revenue) for the third quarter. The carrier expects RASM for the third quarter to decline 3-4% year over year. This marks an improvement from the 8.2% decline in the second quarter. We are also positive on the U.S. DOT's decision to grant final approval to eight carriers  including JetBlue  to initiate commercial flights to Havana. The approval was gained on the same day the first U.S. flight landed in Cuba in more than 50 years. The flight from Fort Lauderdale to Santa Clara was operated by JetBlue. Moreover  the carrier has an impressive history with respect to earnings per share. JetBlue Airways managed to outperform the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters with an average earnings beat of 7.76%. We expect the carrier to perform well in the third quarter as well. In fact  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter has increased by 7 cents to 59 cents per share over the last three months. In view of the above positives  we believe that JetBlue Airways has significant scope for share price appreciation the near term and hence  advice investors to add the stock to their portfolio.”,positive
“Buy JetBlue Before It Takes Off Shares of JetBlue (JBLU) soared over 70% in 2015 before leveling off and then diving back down to retrace the entire gain in June this year. Since then  they have been building a base formation and look prepared to break out of the pattern and start climbing again. The weekly chart shows the rally in the stock price that really began in late 2014 and the steady ascent above the rising 50-day moving average. In late 2015  momentum began to stall  and the stock started to trade in a horizontal channel range  eventually forming a quadruple top and then taking out channel support in the $23.75 area. The trend reversed at that point  and the stock began moving lower below a declining 50-day average. At the June low  the stock briefly closed under the $16 level about where it began in 2015  but it's managed to rebound  move back up above the 50-day moving average and to the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the 2012 low and the 2015 high. Moving average convergence/divergence is making a bullish crossover on this timeframe  and the stochastic oscillator has moved out of its oversold zone  and is crossing above its center line. Chaikin money flow moved over its 21-period signal average last month and is crossing into positive territory. These are intermediate-term positive price and money flow momentum indications.On the daily chart  the basing action over the last two months has formed a cup and handle pattern with rim line resistance in the $19 area  a level which  in addition to being a key Fibonacci retracement level  also supplied support for the stock price in the first five months of the year. Now both the downtrend line drawn off the highs since the 2015 high and the 50-day moving average have been taken out  and the rim line of the pattern is being tested. The technical indicators on this timeframe suggest continued momentum supported by positive money flow. Moving average convergence/divergence and the relative strength index and are tracking higher and above their center lines  and accumulation/distribution is above its signal line with Chaikin money flow well into positive territory.”,positive
“ JetBlue Is a Top-Flight Stock Set to Gain Altitude A big market selloff couldn’t keep JetBlue grounded Tuesday  following the airline’s upbeat August traffic metrics. JetBlue Airways (ticker: JBLU) said that it grew passenger traffic 6.2% in August  on a 5.7% increase in capacity. Its load factor—the percentage of its seats filled—edged up to 87.4% from 87% a year ago. It completed 98.7% of its flights with 70.3% on time. That helped to overshadow revenue per available seat mile (RASM)  which fell 5.5% in August. JetBlue expects third-quarter RASM to fall between 3% and 4% year over year. The shares climbed 2.8% to $17.25 in recent trading. While the stock is down 23% this year  we think things are looking up for JetBlue. It’s been a tough year for airlines given generally lower fares  intense competition among carriers  Zika fears  and the industry’s own missteps. However  the business is cyclical  and JetBlue looks like one of the industry’s stronger names. Earlier this month Raymond James’ Savanthi Syth argued that investor concerns about competitive capacity trends are already reflected in JetBlue shares. What’s not recognized is the potential upside from several income initiatives: “RASM should continue to benefit from several ongoing income initiatives including Fare Options and the new co-branded credit card agreement. Further  JetBlue’s cabin refresh project is set to commence in the second half of 2016  which we believe will be accretive beginning in 2017.” JetBlue’s premium service Mint  which has delivered strong RASM  is set to expand with a Boston to Los Angeles route next quarter  with more new routes planned for 2017. Rival Delta Air Lines (DAL) is beefing up its presence in Boston  but JetBlue’s better-than-expected second-quarter earnings  reported in late July  demonstrated its resilience. And management highlighted its plans to boost its West Coast presence and add 30 new planes to accommodate its increasing Mint offerings. “During the first half of 2016 JetBlue saw positive unit revenue growth in Mint markets vs. a system unit revenue decline of about 8%  while Mint cabin specific unit revenue growth in the first half was close to double digits ” writes Evercore ISI’s Duane Pfennigwerth. “The company believes its premium cabin potential extends well beyond New York to Los Angeles and San Francisco markets and has announced new Mint transcon service to Fort Lauderdale  Vegas  Seattle and San Diego  with additional Caribbean service expected over time.” Trading at 8.5 times forward earnings JetBlue isn’t as cheap as some of the legacy airlines  but it’s less expensive than peers like Alaska Air (ALK) and Southwest Airlines(LUV). JetBlue’s earnings per share are expected to rise 8.6% this year. It could take more than a few months of solid traffic gains to help JetBlue’s shares recover lost ground  but we think that recent gains are a sign of what’s ahead.”,positive
