“It’s no secret that America’s airports are decaying  crumbling and in the words of Donald Trump  resemble those of third world nations. According to the most recent report card from the American Society of Civil Engineers  on a letter scale of A to F conditions at America’s airports received a grade of D. Congress can and should address this issue by eliminating the federal airline tax and allowing as well as municipalities to collect sufficient funds to modernize their airports. Such a move would eliminate Washington as the middleman and ensure more taxpayer dollars are going directly toward building airports and updating existing ones for the modern age. The big three domestic airlines – Delta Air Lines  United Continental Holdings  Airlines and American Airlines Group – are all expected to deliver some of the best earnings in years according to Wall Street analyst estimates collected by Bloomberg and other sources as are JetBlue Airways and Virgin America (VA). While some of that will be due to lower fuel costs  revenues are also climbing due to more airline passenger travel and “ancillary revenues.”According to Ed Perkins of the Chicago Tribune  U.S. legacy airlines will make a good percentage of their profit off of “ancillary revenues” that include revenues from activities that are outside the scope of transporting passengers to and from the destinations and points of departure. Examples include things like commissions for hotel referrals  checked bag fees  which incidentally  are not taxed as profit by the IRS.  If you compare your total airline travel costs over the last few years  you would notice a pronounced increase in the ancillary components. The Chicago Times story reports that fees collected from ancillary activities for “Alaska  American  Delta  Hawaiian  Southwest and United — will amount to $18 billion  or about 11 percent of total revenues ” up more than twice the 4.6 percent of total revenues in 2010 according to data published by IdeaWorks. The story goes on to cite that checked bag fees provide 20% of the total revenues.  In essence  government tax policy has encouraged travelers to be nickeled and dimed to death. In the coming months  Congress is expected to begin debating legislation titled the “Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Authorization” bill  which offers an opportunity to change federal aviation tax policy.  House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Bill Schuster (R-Pa.) could free market forces in the aviation travel industry by pushing reform of the aviation tax system. Depending on the outcome of the FAA bill  we could have a tax system that does not incentivize the airlines to hike ancillary fees  like your bag and flight change fees  but would still allow for airport upgrades and improvements. What are some of the items that if reformed would help restore free market forces to the air travel economy? First is the Anti-Head Tax Act that was passed in 1973 and prevents an airport from charging a passenger for departing or arriving at a specific airport.  Next are federal domestic flight taxes that include a 7.5% tax on the price of the airline ticket and a $4.00 flight segment tax  plus a September 11th security tax of $5.60 and a Passenger Facility Charge that the airports are allowed to charge up to $4.50.  Applying that to the U.S domestic average itinerary fare of $391 in 2014 per the Bureau of Transportation Statistics  equates to more than $43. By itself  one may not think that adds up to much  but factor in the more than 662.8 million passengers that few in 2014 alone  and it those fees quickly add up to big bucks. A repeal of the Anti-Head tax in conjunction with a repeal  or severely cutting  the many taxes that are built into every ticket a passenger purchases would serve two important purposes.  First  it would allow local airports to set up a taxation system to pay for upgrades so that our nation’s decrepit airports could be made great again.  Right now airlines are allowed to collect at $4.50 Passenger Facility Charge  but they are also supposed to get resources from the federal Airport Improvement Program funded by the massive federal taxes imposed on every fare.  Much of the money is wasted and not efficiently given to airports and you need merely to look at LaGuardia Airport as a prime example.Presidential candidate Donald Trump frequently makes fun of LaGuardia Airport and calls it a “third world dump” because it is so run down  and that is just one of like many our nations’ 18 762 airport facilities used for general aviation purposes.  Restoring authority to local airports to collect fees on travelers would take the federal government middleman out of the calculation.  Right now they have to beg the FAA to remit money when they want to upgrade a facility. Second  taking most  if not all  of the high taxes and fees off the ticket price would remove the incentive for the airlines to use untaxed ancillary fees to make huge profits.  High federal ticket taxes are one of the reasons why airlines resort to massive fees on checked bags and ticket changes in part because those are untaxed activities.  Radically lower taxes on ticket prices will help consumers and the airlines in the short and long term because lower costs should help spur more airline travel and likely drive additional spending at airports. When Congress takes up legislation to authorize FAA programs they need to consider reforms that will provide a stimulus  not a hindrance to the industry.  Speaker Paul Ryan and House Transportation Committee Chairman Bill Schuster have an opportunity to change policy that will help upgrade airports  lower the interference of the federal government in how much you consumers pay to fly and make sure that our airports are no longer holdovers from the last century.”,positive
“JetBlue Airways more than doubled its fourth quarter profit  compared to a year earlier  as lower fuel costs and a surge of new customers bolstered the bottom line.The airline's net income swung from $88 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 to $190 million in the fourth quarter of 2015. Full-year net income rose from $401 million to $677 million.Operating revenue increased 10.2% for the quarter to $1.59 billion and 10.3% for the year to $6.42 billion. The company posted earnings per share of 56 cents  besting the S&P Capital IQconsensus analyst estimate of 51 cents. JetBlue shares (JBLU) surged 5.9% to $22.50 in pre-market trading. “We posted another strong quarter  producing above industry average revenue performance and running a safe and reliable operation " JetBlue CEO Robin Hayessaid in a statement. "I want to thank all our 18 000 crewmembers for their terrific efforts throughout the year." The airline is getting a substantive boost from the plunging price of oil. The average price of jet fuel the company paid in the fourth quarter was $1.68 per gallon  reflecting a 37.8% decline from a year earlier. Despite $33 million in losses on fuel hedging in the fourth quarter  the company is positioned to benefit substantially from lower fuel prices in the first and second quarters of 2016  when it has no fuel hedges in place. An investment in additional capacity paid off during the quarter  too  as revenue passenger miles — a gauge of how far customers paid to travel — rose 12.4%  outpacing the 10.4% capacity increase.”,positive
“Southwest Airlines and JetBlue are the best U.S.-based frequent-flyer programs when it comes to award seat availability  a new survey has concluded. According to The Wall Street Journal  consulting firm IdeaWorks surveyed 25 airlines both domestic and international  and found that two seats at the lowest level of each program were available for 77 percent of the booking queries made this year. That is a 3 percent increase over 2015.  "Overall  I think the consumer is being better served than the year before " said Jay Sorensen  president of IdeaWorks. "This survey reflects the fact that airlines can’t afford to take their customers for granted. 21st century consumers are savvy and plugged-in " added Switchfly CEO Daniel Farrar  who worked in tandem with IdeaWorks to issue the seventh annual Switchfly Reward Seat Availability Survey.  American Airlines' AAdvantage program ranked last among U.S. airlines  with 56 percent seat availability.  "Their loyalty program needs attention " Sorensen commented.  The survey concluded that frequent flyers are  on average  best served by value-oriented airlines. Southwest definitely fits that description  as it does not offer assigned seating  enabling it to fill planes to capacity more easily  which in turn drives down prices. The lack of assigned seats also improves seat availability  helping it move to the top of the annual list. Combined  the top six U.S. and international value-oriented airlines offered 87 percent seat availability  compared to 72 percent offered by more traditional airlines. The survey found that seat availability also fluctuated seasonally. It was best in September and October  and worst in July. “,positive
“Southwest soars: Investors love LUV Lower fuel prices = record profits for the airline industry. Southwest  United and Alaska Air all reported strong earnings Thursday. It was the best second quarter ever for Alaska Air (ALK) and highest profit for any quarter atUnited (UAL) and Southwest (LUV). Southwest said it saved $500 million on fuel costs in the quarter. United saved nearly $1 billion. Investors  for the most part  loved the news. Shares of Southwest soared 5% while United was up 3%. Alaska Air's stock did pull back though. But the U.S. Global Jets (JETS) exchange-traded fund  which owns these three airlines as well as shares of Delta (DAL)  JetBlue (JBLU)  Spirit (SAVE) and Virgin America (VA)  was higher. Delta reported results last week. American (AAL) and Spirit will report their earnings Friday while JetBlue and Virgin America are on tap to release their latest results next week. The airline industry is now in much healthier shape than arguably any other time in its history. The plunge in oil prices since last summer has only made things better. A wave of airline mergers has led to more rational pricing strategies by the big carriers. The days of huge fare wars seem to be over. That's great news for investors  even if it's bad news for travelers. Many airlines have boosted revenue though by adding on higher fees and surcharges for things like checking bags and pre-printing boarding passes. Still  there have been some concerns on Wall Street lately that the good times for the industry may soon be over. JetBlue and Alaska Air are the only two major airline stocks up this year. The rest have fallen on fears that profit margins may be close to peaking. Fuel prices  while still down sharply  are up from their lows. And the Department of Justice has accused Southwest  Delta  United and American of possibly colluding to keep capacity growth down. Doing so could keep fares higher than they otherwise would be. There have been some calls for airlines to cut ticket prices because fuel costs have dropped so dramatically. But Southwest said that its average ticket price dropped 3.4% from a year ago to $157.51. United and Delta also both reported declines in a key airline metric known as passenger revenue which accounts for fares and fees. The strong dollar is partly to blame for this though  since it reduces the value of what foreign travelers pay to fly. Still  the airline industry may be in a rare state of cruising altitude for both investors and passengers. Profits are climbing and consumers can still find some good bargains.”,positive
“JetBlue earnings climb 18.5% on cheaper fuel  growing Mint JetBlue Airways reported an 18.5% rise in second-quarter earnings Tuesday  riding low fuel prices that have benefited the airline industry for a year and growth in its premium Mint service for transcontinental flights. The New York-based airline reported $180 million in net income for April  May and June  up from $152 million for the same period a year earlier. Revenues were up 2% in the second quarter  to $1.6 billion. And fuel costs declined 26%  to $274 million  compared to a year earlier. At 53 cents of earnings per diluted share  the results beat estimates of 49 cents per share  according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. Jim Corridore  an analyst with S&P Global Market Intelligence  maintained a "strong buy" recommendation because pressures on unit revenues are expected to lessen after the summer. CEO Robin Hayes called it “another great quarter.” Looking forward  he said the airline would continue to grow its transcontinental market with the Mint premium service stimulating demand and improving revenue for each available mile flown by 20% since its introduction in 2014. “Mint has surpassed our expectations on every customer and financial measure ” Hayes said. JetBlue announced Tuesday it would expand Mint by amending a purchase agreement with Airbus to bring 30 more A321 aircraft into its fleet over seven years. Of those  15 A321 aircraft will begin arriving next year. Another 15 A321neo aircraft will start arriving in 2020. The airline had announced earlier this year it would expand Mint to  Fort Lauderdale  Las Vegas  San Diego and Seattle  while also increasing options from New York's John F. Kennedy airport  Boston and Los Angeles. Once those flights have launched  JetBlue will have more than 70 Mint flights daily from the East Coast  West Coast andCaribbean. JetBlue continues to grow. The airline increased its capacity 11.1% for the quarter and had a 10.3% increase in the miles that passengers paid to fly  at 11.6 billion. But the planes flew slightly less full than a year earlier  a 0.6 point drop to 85%. The yield for flying each passenger a mile fell nearly 10%  to 12.87 cents.”,positive
“Why Is JetBlue Airways (JBLU) a Must-Add for Your Portfolio? On Oct 4  2016  we issued an updated research report on JetBlue Airways Corporation JBLU . The Long Island City  NY-based low-cost carrier currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)  indicating that it will outperform the broader market in the near term. We are impressed by the renewable jet fuel purchase agreement between JetBlue Airways and SG Preston last month. Under this deal  which is aimed at reducing carbon emissions  JetBlue is expected to purchase over 33 million gallons of blended fuel per year from SG Preston over a period of 10 years. This deal is by far the largest  binding commitment for hydro-processed esters and fatty acids (HEFA)-based renewable fuel purchase over a long term by an airline company. We are also impressed by the company's bullish guidance for total revenue per available seat mile (RASM: a key measure of unit revenue) for the third quarter. The carrier expects RASM for the third quarter to decline 3-4% year over year. This marks an improvement from the 8.2% decline in the second quarter. We are also positive on the U.S. DOT's decision to grant final approval to eight carriers  including JetBlue  to initiate commercial flights to Havana. The approval was gained on the same day the first U.S. flight landed in Cuba in more than 50 years. The flight from Fort Lauderdale to Santa Clara was operated by JetBlue. Moreover  the carrier has an impressive history with respect to earnings per share. JetBlue Airways managed to outperform the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters with an average earnings beat of 7.76%. We expect the carrier to perform well in the third quarter as well. In fact  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter has increased by 7 cents to 59 cents per share over the last three months. In view of the above positives  we believe that JetBlue Airways has significant scope for share price appreciation the near term and hence  advice investors to add the stock to their portfolio.”,positive
“Buy JetBlue Before It Takes Off Shares of JetBlue (JBLU) soared over 70% in 2015 before leveling off and then diving back down to retrace the entire gain in June this year. Since then  they have been building a base formation and look prepared to break out of the pattern and start climbing again. The weekly chart shows the rally in the stock price that really began in late 2014 and the steady ascent above the rising 50-day moving average. In late 2015  momentum began to stall  and the stock started to trade in a horizontal channel range  eventually forming a quadruple top and then taking out channel support in the $23.75 area. The trend reversed at that point  and the stock began moving lower below a declining 50-day average. At the June low  the stock briefly closed under the $16 level about where it began in 2015  but it's managed to rebound  move back up above the 50-day moving average and to the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the 2012 low and the 2015 high. Moving average convergence/divergence is making a bullish crossover on this timeframe  and the stochastic oscillator has moved out of its oversold zone  and is crossing above its center line. Chaikin money flow moved over its 21-period signal average last month and is crossing into positive territory. These are intermediate-term positive price and money flow momentum indications.On the daily chart  the basing action over the last two months has formed a cup and handle pattern with rim line resistance in the $19 area  a level which  in addition to being a key Fibonacci retracement level  also supplied support for the stock price in the first five months of the year. Now both the downtrend line drawn off the highs since the 2015 high and the 50-day moving average have been taken out  and the rim line of the pattern is being tested. The technical indicators on this timeframe suggest continued momentum supported by positive money flow. Moving average convergence/divergence and the relative strength index and are tracking higher and above their center lines  and accumulation/distribution is above its signal line with Chaikin money flow well into positive territory.”,positive
“ JetBlue Is a Top-Flight Stock Set to Gain Altitude A big market selloff couldn’t keep JetBlue grounded Tuesday  following the airline’s upbeat August traffic metrics. JetBlue Airways (ticker: JBLU) said that it grew passenger traffic 6.2% in August  on a 5.7% increase in capacity. Its load factor—the percentage of its seats filled—edged up to 87.4% from 87% a year ago. It completed 98.7% of its flights with 70.3% on time. That helped to overshadow revenue per available seat mile (RASM)  which fell 5.5% in August. JetBlue expects third-quarter RASM to fall between 3% and 4% year over year. The shares climbed 2.8% to $17.25 in recent trading. While the stock is down 23% this year  we think things are looking up for JetBlue. It’s been a tough year for airlines given generally lower fares  intense competition among carriers  Zika fears  and the industry’s own missteps. However  the business is cyclical  and JetBlue looks like one of the industry’s stronger names. Earlier this month Raymond James’ Savanthi Syth argued that investor concerns about competitive capacity trends are already reflected in JetBlue shares. What’s not recognized is the potential upside from several income initiatives: “RASM should continue to benefit from several ongoing income initiatives including Fare Options and the new co-branded credit card agreement. Further  JetBlue’s cabin refresh project is set to commence in the second half of 2016  which we believe will be accretive beginning in 2017.” JetBlue’s premium service Mint  which has delivered strong RASM  is set to expand with a Boston to Los Angeles route next quarter  with more new routes planned for 2017. Rival Delta Air Lines (DAL) is beefing up its presence in Boston  but JetBlue’s better-than-expected second-quarter earnings  reported in late July  demonstrated its resilience. And management highlighted its plans to boost its West Coast presence and add 30 new planes to accommodate its increasing Mint offerings. “During the first half of 2016 JetBlue saw positive unit revenue growth in Mint markets vs. a system unit revenue decline of about 8%  while Mint cabin specific unit revenue growth in the first half was close to double digits ” writes Evercore ISI’s Duane Pfennigwerth. “The company believes its premium cabin potential extends well beyond New York to Los Angeles and San Francisco markets and has announced new Mint transcon service to Fort Lauderdale  Vegas  Seattle and San Diego  with additional Caribbean service expected over time.” Trading at 8.5 times forward earnings JetBlue isn’t as cheap as some of the legacy airlines  but it’s less expensive than peers like Alaska Air (ALK) and Southwest Airlines(LUV). JetBlue’s earnings per share are expected to rise 8.6% this year. It could take more than a few months of solid traffic gains to help JetBlue’s shares recover lost ground  but we think that recent gains are a sign of what’s ahead.”,positive
