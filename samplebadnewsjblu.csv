"Why JetBlue (JBLU) Stock is Slumping Today JetBlue (JBLU) stock is down as this weekend's mass shooting in Florida weighs on the airline sector. NEW YORK (TheStreet) --Shares of JetBlue (JBLU) are down by 3.96% to $17.38 in early afternoon trading on Monday, as the airline sector is pressured by concerns about travel safety amid a mass shooting in the U.S. and an airport bombing in Shanghai. In the early morning hours of Sunday, June 12, patrons at an LGBT nightclub in Orlando, FL found themselves trapped in the building with a lone gunman. Fifty people were killed and another 53 were wounded in the attack. The shooter, identified as Omar Mateen, was armed with an assault rifle and a pistol. Mateen was also killed on Sunday. The shooter is said to have dialed 911 while inside the club in order to pledge his loyalty to the Islamic State.

Airline stocks will sometimes struggle in the wake of terrorist acts due to concern that people will become less likely to travel as fears over safety mount. Additionally, airline stocks are also being impacted today by an explosion at an airport that left five people injured in Shanghai. Police are holding a migrant factory worker with online gambling debts responsible for the bombing. The factory worker had apparently issued a warning to friends that he was on a suicide mission, the Wall Street Journal reports.
